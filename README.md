We conduct some experiments to show the empirical performance of 'Distributed Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Tracking Algorithm on the Stiefel Manifold' and compare it with the state-of-art stochastic algorithms. 
The experiments are performed on a platform with 11th Gen Intel CPU (at 2.50GHz*16) and 15.5GB of RAM under Ubuntu 20.04.6. 
The distributed structure is established with the help of Bluefog and computation on the Stiefel manifold is Pymanopt toolbox.
